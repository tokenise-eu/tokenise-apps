# Tokenise.eu Off-Chain Applications

This repository contains all the off-chain applications used to augment the on-chain protocols, allowing them to become compliant to regulations and providing necessary safety measures in case of newly discovered security flaws. All the applications will store their data in a standardized manner to allow for cross-chain migration when necessary.

The protocol is still very much under construction. This and other related repositories will be much more expanded and fully documented as development progresses.
