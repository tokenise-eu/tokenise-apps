# Tokenise.eu Ethereum Applications

This subsection contains a collection of all the applications which are used off-chain to support the Ethereum version of the protocol. Together with the smart contracts, these applications will ensure compliance to regulatory standards, and provide safety backdoors for multiple cases (namely security updates and cross-chain migration).

Each application will become bundled with their own README to further explain their utility.
